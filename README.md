## Summary of the app

In our app, the user will enter a location. 
The app will contact OpenWeatherMap API 
to request climate data; 
OpenStreetMap via Overpass API to request point 
of interest data; 
and Flickr or YouTube API to request photo
or video data. 
The app will present this data to the user 
in this way: As a webpage that displays 
the average daily weather, 
points of interest and relevant photos and/or 
videos.
